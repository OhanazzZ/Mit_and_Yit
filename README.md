Three core functionalities, users system, matching system and review system, have been implemented separately by using three routers. Detailed descriptions are listed below. 

Currently our database has users with id 1~9. The data structure of Users data is 
{
  "id": int,  //a unique int that identify a user
  "username": String,
  "email": String,
  "cuisine": String, //their food preference
  "lunch": Boolean, //availability for lunch 
  "dinner": Boolean, //availability for dinner
  "coffee_lightMeal": Boolean, //availability for coffee
  "reviewIndex": int //a unique index position that help to retrieve user's review from the Review database
}

Exapmle of data structure in Review data: The below data is the review for user id 1, which is at index 0 position. 
{
        score:3.5, //int, average score calculated based on all reviews
        scoreNum:2, //int, number of review messages received
        review:[ //an array that store all review messages 
            {
                givenBy:2,
                date:"03-04-2019",
                score:4,
                tag:["nice","interesting"],
                comment: "really nice and kind",
            },
            {
                givenBy:7,
                date:"09-04-2019",
                score:3,
                tag:["boring","kind"],
                comment: "xx is nice but we have no common interest",
            },
        ]
    }


1. Users' information system (userRouter)

Our first core functionality is user system. It allows to view all usersâ€™ information, extract an existing user's information, modify existing user's information, and add new user to json file.  

https://mityit.herokuapp.com/user/info : a GET request that retrieve all users' information

https://mityit.herokuapp.com/user/info/:id : a GET request that retrieve a particular user's information by id

https://mityit.herokuapp.com/user/info/:id : a PATCH request that update an exisiting user's information by id
Input JSON file:
{
  "id": int,
  "username": String,
  "email": String,
  "cuisine": String,
  "lunch": Boolean,
  "dinner": Boolean,
  "coffee_lightMeal": Boolean,
  "reviewIndex": int
}

E.g 
Url to test: https://mityit.herokuapp.com/user/info/7
Original information:
{
    "id": 7,
    "username": "user7",
    "email": "email_7@gmail.com",
    "cuisine": "Italian",
    "lunch": true,
    "dinner": true,
    "coffee_lightMeal": false,
    "reviewIndex": 6
  },
Make changes(JSON code to test): 
{
    "id": 7,
    "username": "user7_newname",
    "email": "email_7@gmail.com",
    "cuisine": "Korean",
    "lunch": true,
    "dinner": true,
    "coffee_lightMeal": false,
    "reviewIndex": 6
  },

    
https://mityit.herokuapp.com/user/signup : a POST request that add a new user's information
Input JSON file: 
{
  "username": String,
  "email": String,
  "cuisine": String,
  "lunch": Boolean,
  "dinner": Boolean,
  "coffee_lightMeal": Boolean,
  "reviewIndex": int
}


2. Matching Systen (matchRouter)

In matching system, a user can find all suitable partners that matches him/her based on either cuisine preference or time availability.

https://mityit.herokuapp.com/match/:id : a GET request that retrieve all matches for a user (based on both cuisine and availability)

https://mityit.herokuapp.com/match/find_cuisine/:id : a GET request that find matches for a user by cuisine 

https://mityit.herokuapp.com/match/find_availability/:id : a GET request that find matches for a user by availability  

  
3. Review System (reviewRouter)

Router for review system allows to find reviews, edit existing review and upload new review for a specific user.

https://mityit.herokuapp.com/review/:id : a GET request that get reviews written to the user identifiable by the provided ID

https://mityit.herokuapp.com/review/:id : a POST request that write a new review to the user identifiable by the provided ID 
Input JSON file: 
{
"givenBy": int,
"date": date,
"score": int,
"tag": array of Strings,
"comment": String
}

https://mityit.herokuapp.com/review/:id : a PATCH request that modeify an existing review to the user identifiable by the provided ID 
Input JSON file: the same data structure as review POST request

The web app we are creating is a social dining platform.

## Deliverable 2 descrpition:

The link to Git repository for the web application is https://github.com/GilfoylePP/Mit_and_Yit--INFO30005.  
The URL to the live website is https://mityit.herokuapp.com.  
The commit id is **8308318** (**_please update this after the final commit_**).  


Three core functionalities, **user profile**, **matching system** and **review system**, have been implemented separately by using three routers. Detailed descriptions are listed below. 

Below is the data structure for users. Currently our database has users with id 1~9.  
```markdown
{  
    "id":               int,      // a unique int that identifies a user  
    "username":         String,  
    "email":            String,  
    "cuisine":          String,   // their food preference  
    "lunch":            Boolean,  // availability for lunch   
    "dinner":           Boolean,  // availability for dinner  
    "coffee_lightMeal": Boolean,  // availability for coffee  
    "reviewIndex":      int       // a unique index position that help to retrieve user's review from the Review database  
}  
```
Below is an exapmle of the data structure for reviews, which shows the review for user id 1, which is at index 0 position.   
```
{  
   score:          3.5,  // int, average score calculated based on all reviews  
   scoreNum:       2,    // int, number of review messages received  
   review:               // an array that store all review messages  
        [{  
          givenBy: 2,  
          date:    "03-04-2019",  
          tag:     ["nice","interesting"],  
          comment: "really nice and kind",  
         },  
         {  
          givenBy: 7,  
          date:    "09-04-2019",  
          score:   3,  
          tag:     ["boring","kind"],  
          comment: "xx is nice but we have no common interest",  
         }]  
}  
```

### 1. Users' information system (userRouter)

Our first core functionality is user system. It allows to view all usersâ€™ information, extract an existing user's information, modify existing user's information, and add new user to json file.

  * **GET** request - retrieve all users' information  

* https://mityit.herokuapp.com/user/info/:id :  
  * **GET** request - retrieve a particular user's information by id  

* https://mityit.herokuapp.com/user/info/:id :  
  * **PATCH** request - update an exisiting user's information by id  
Input JSON file: 
```
{  
  "id":               int,  
  "username":         String,  
  "email":            String,  
  "cuisine":          String,  
  "lunch":            Boolean,  
  "dinner":           Boolean,  
  "coffee_lightMeal": Boolean,  
  "reviewIndex":      int  
}  
```
&emsp;&emsp;  Example for updating an existing user's information:

},
```
&emsp;&emsp;  Make changes(JSON code to test):
